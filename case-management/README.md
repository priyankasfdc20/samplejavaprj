The Case Management frontend application for Child Welfare Digital Services.

Please see our [Wiki](https://github.com/ca-cwds/case-management/wiki) for the latest documentation.

## Getting Started

It is **_strongly recommended_** to have [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) installed. Application development should occur within the docker container. We're hoping this lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors and reduces the occurence of _works on my machine_ bugs.

### Launching the Dev Server

As a convenience, an `npm script` is provided to spin up the dev server with a `bind-mount` in a docker container.

```
yarn start
```

or you can invoke using the docker cli:

```sh
docker build -t cwds/casemanagement .
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm  \
  --publish "3000":"3000" \
  --publish "3035":"3035" \
  --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)"/app,dst=/app/app,consistency=cached \
  cwds/casemanagement foreman start -f Procfile.dev.docker
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
