     * CASE.ID - The system generated unique identifier for each CASE. Although each CASE can be uniquely identified by a CLIENT and the CASE Start Date, an ID will allow STAFF_PERSONs to quickly reference existing CASEs. It will also help preserve confidentiality by not making it necessary to reference a child's name to identify a CASE. This ID has an internal 10 digit alpha-numeric representation and an external 19 digit numeric representation. The external representation is displayed at the User Interface or on Reports and Documents in the following format: 1234-1234-1234-1234567. The inclusion of the hyphens used in the formatting of this string results in a 22 byte display area. This ID is composed of the concatenation of a Creation Timestamp and the STAFF_PERSON ID. This value eliminates the need for an additional set of Creation Timestamp and Creation User ID which is needed to satisfy the Audit Trail requirement. The Creation Timestamp is a 'bit-shifted' timestamp representation which provides up to 1/100 of a second time granularity. The Timestamp uses a two digit internal year representation. An algorithm which generates a user displayable Timestamp value is provided which generates the century based upon the year value. When the year is less than 55, a value of 2000 is added, otherwise a value of 1900 is added as the century. The STAFF_PERSON ID is a sequential 3 digit base 62 number generated by the system. The STAFF_PERSON ID (3 bytes) is appended to the 7 digit internal timestamp value to provide the final 10 byte result.

There may be many ASSIGNMENTs considered to be 'primary' over the life of the CASE or REFERRAL, but only one of them is current at any time. An ASSIGNMENT can be either designated as Primary (P), Secondary (S), or Read Only (R). Primary assigned workers have the capability to retrieve, read, and update any case or referral to which they have direct or indirect assignment. Similarly, Secondary assigned workers also have the same capabilities to retrieve, read, and update any case or referral to which they ave direct or indirect assignment. In fact, Secondary workers for the most part have the same capabilities as the Primary worker, but occasionally there are business rules in the application which prohibit the Secondary worker from doing something that the Primary worker can do (i.e. requesting the closure of an Adoptions Case). Read Only assigned workers have the capability to access and read any case or referral to which they have direct or indirect assignment, but they do not have update capability. = ['PRIMARY', 'SECONDARY', 'READ_ONLY
